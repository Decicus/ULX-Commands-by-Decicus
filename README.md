ULX Commands by Decicus
=======================
This is the developer repository for "ULX Commands by Decicus". Which is an addon/module for a Garry's Mod admin mod.  
You can read more about it on the Ulysses Forums: [http://forums.ulyssesmod.net/index.php/topic,6782.0.html](http://forums.ulyssesmod.net/index.php/topic,6782.0.html)  
I do not recommend using the developer code unless it's already been tested and uploaded on the thread.
  
Requirements
=======================
ULib and ULX: [http://ulyssesmod.net/](http://ulyssesmod.net/)
